We're calling Andromeda!

My name is Commander Tom

You're on board of our spaceship Voyager X5ten

On our flight to the andomeda fog.
At the moment we have an information breakdown with our mothership
Andromeda

And so we're lost
Lost
Lost
Lost
Lost
Lost
Lost
Lost.

Flying out of the station we're lost in space

Got no communication with our human race.

We're falling Andromeda!

Drifting out of direction
Let all systems run

Radar reflection on planet sun.

Mayday
Mayday! Calling mothership
Calling mothership

Million lightyears from home

Million lightyears from home
From home

From home
From home

From home!

Lost in the ocean of the galaxy

No signal
No motion
Human fantasy.
